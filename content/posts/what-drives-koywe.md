We’re living in troubled times. Protests, social unrest, and violence seem to be growing around the world. Distrust, conspiracies, and polarization are the norm in a world where, thanks to the internet, there are infinite narratives. At the same time, scientific data points to a climate crisis that’s increasingly harder to avoid.

At Koywe we believe all these issues require us to think new models and incentive structures, just to start working on the solutions. How can we have platforms that enhance trust instead of diminish it? How do we stop subsidizing fossil fuels? How do we organize and coordinate around common goals when trust is so low? How do we get selfish people to change the way they transact and interact with others?

Luckily, we believe, humanity has developed powerful tools to help answer some of these questions. They’re not a silver bullet, they’re not gonna solve all the problems, but they represent opportunities to do things better. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are new ways to communicate, store value, and model our incentive structures. The so called web3 is all about trying out these new tools, evolve them, make them better, and iterate to bring decentralized and unstoppable economic games that nudge us to behave in pro social ways.

We started Koywe with this belief, thinking it’s very well suited to tackle the issue which, in our view, is the most pressing one: climate change. For this, we have built the Koywe forest, a place where users can use and interact with the best Regenerative Finance, ReFi, projects.

But we want to go beyond. Languages are maybe the most important and fundamentally human things we have invented (also, our first decentralized protocols!). These new tools are a new language and there is a big region in the world that’s hardly conversational: Latin America.

Koywe is building platforms to provide Latin Americans with access to these new tools, resources to understand and become fluent, and places to engage with the best protocols, tokens, and economic games deployed on the different blockchains.

Our first step is a ramp for people to buy and sell crypto in the simplest way, regardless of where their wallets are, and in their local currencies. Buy ETH and send it to your MetaMask wallet in 2 minutes, paying in pesos or soles, or sell BTC and get local currency delivered within minutes to your bank account.

Today we’re glad to launch our public beta to facilitate buying ETH in Chile, making it the fastest and most convenient way to get tokens delivered to any wallet. Soon, we will launch in Mexico and Colombia.

After building the basis for a transparent layer between blockchains and local currencies, we want to build tools and public goods for users to start leveraging the whole permissionless infrastructure already built on web3.

Koywe wants to build the highway for Latin Americans to be a part of this new way of doing things. We want to help create new native speakers of this new language, who not only consume content and platforms, but also contribute to the evolution of new forms of speech. We do this not because we want to, because we need to.
