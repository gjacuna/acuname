          <p>Hello again! <strong>This is the first official installment of my new experiment</strong>. Read chapter 0 here: <a href="https://acuna.eth.limo/2022/a-new-experiment/" title="https://acuna.eth.limo/2022/a-new-experiment/">https://acuna.eth.limo/2022/a-new-experiment/</a></p>
<p><strong>Today, I‚Äôll write about risk, time, and value.</strong> ü§ë</p>
<p>It‚Äôs amazing how little we know about our financial systems. Specially the underlying assumptions, models, and unwritten rules that govern them. Maybe they&rsquo;re so ingrained in our society that we just take them for granted?</p>
<p>Back when I was at <a href="https://cumplo.com" title="Cumplo">Cumplo</a> I thought I understood some of those assumptions. I would actually teach a short ‚Äúclass‚Äù based on them to our newest colleagues. Now I realize I wasn‚Äôt asking enough questions, <strong>because some concepts just seemed obvious, logical, or rational.</strong></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with the cumplo notions and see if they hold their ground.</p>
<p>If I offered you 1,000 dollars, when would you want them, today or in a year from now?</p>
<p><strong>If you‚Äôre a modern human, you‚Äôd say <em>‚Äútoday‚Äù</em>!</strong></p>
<p>Now, how much more would I need to offer in a year for you to accept it? 1,050? 1,200? <strong>2,000?</strong></p>
<p>If you decide you trust me, and you think like my finance professor, you would say ‚Äúas much as a ‚Äòrisk free‚Äô investment would pay‚Äù, whatever that means. If you don‚Äôt trust me, you‚Äôd probably demand a higher premium, according to my perceived <em>‚Äúrisk‚Äù</em>.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúAnd that, kids, is why interest is charged when lending money. There is a risk involved, which gets quantified in the rate being charged. <strong>Guillermo is risky, so charge him at least 50% annually</strong>.‚Äù</em> That&rsquo;s as far as I used to take my intro to lending.</p>
<p>It makes sense, or at least we‚Äôve been told it does. <em>Money today is worth more than money tomorrow</em> because <strong>we could do things with the money</strong> in the meantime and/or <strong>there is a risk</strong> we won‚Äôt get the money in the future.</p>
<p>But, does it really make sense? Underlying this is the notion money needs to <strong>always grow</strong> and that you can actually somehow quantify your trust in someone. It also assumes there is a way to have access to a risk-free investment. Furthermore, I would argue it also assumes you have a legal recourse in case you&rsquo;re not paid.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs go back to my initial offer, but now I‚Äôm willing to sign an IOU. Would my rate go lower? What if I offer my house (if I had one) as colateral? In many places, a house is worth more than 1,000 dollars. This should make my <em>&ldquo;risk&rdquo;</em> irrelevant, as long as there is a way to enforce that promise. In most cases, it doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>In many countries, there are laws governing private property and commercial transactions. Not fulfilling your commitments entitles your counterpart to sue you, they have a legal recourse. Even if you don‚Äôt explicitly leave a collateral, they‚Äôre usually entitled to seize your known assets. <strong>If it weren‚Äôt for those laws, and a nation-state enforcing them, IOUs and collaterals would be irrelevant.</strong> I could essentially promise anything, without more consequence than damaging my reputation.</p>
<p>What would happen if those commitments were not enforceable or states decided it wasn‚Äôt their job to mediate such matters? They could say <em>‚Äúyou say you‚Äôre good at assessing risk, you don‚Äôt need us.‚Äù</em> (In reality, we all know we suck at quantifying risk.)</p>
<p>In medieval times Islamic states did just that. <strong>Furthermore, Islam made charging interest rates forbidden</strong>. God, they argued, had created money for the explicit purpose of governing and facilitating transactions, so creating <em>money out of money</em> was a sin. All transactions became equity transactions and people‚Äôs greatest asset was their reputation. Agreements required nothing more than a handshake and <strong>the state was effectively left outside the markets</strong>.</p>
<p>Beyond current and historical markets, what happens if we have programmatically enforceable contracts? <strong>Do we still need a third party to enforce them? To measure risk? To mediate?</strong> How will those tools change how we transact? If I wrote a smart contract that would let you choose between 1,000 USD today or 1,000 in a year, no questions asked, would it change your choice? What if the money were put into a liquidity pool, earning fees from trades through a decentralized exchange? Any day that passes would mean you get more money.</p>
<p>On the other hand, how do we determine if a contract is fair? Going back to the original 1,000 dollar offer and leaving my house as collateral, would it be fair for me? I was willingly signing the contract, right? We‚Äôre equal parties in the transaction, right? <strong>Is a loan from a bank to a person a contract between peers?</strong> How do we move to more humane transactions? It&rsquo;s easy to abstract someone into an interest rate, which makes it easier to act in unfair ways. How does it change when we use a medium that doesn&rsquo;t allow us to be unfair?</p>
<p>Finally, how would everything change if we suddenly agreed that money <strong>doesn&rsquo;t need to grow constantly</strong>? What if we agreed to try to prioritize other things? Or if we simply decided to engage only in equity transactions, in which all partners engage in the same risk?</p>
<p>So many questions, so many ways of doing things, and yet, so many unexplored paths. We haven‚Äôt seen a fundamentally different way of doing things in a long long <strong>LONG</strong> time. Maybe crytptos and blockchains change that? I don&rsquo;t know, I only know I have more questions than answers at this point.</p>
<p>See you next time for more random thoughts, unanswered questions, ramblings, and hopefully some entertainment. This particular rambling was largely inspired by <em>‚ÄúDebt: the first 5,000 years‚Äù</em> by David Graeber.</p>
